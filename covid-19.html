        <p>In light of the outbreak of novel coronavirus, we are monitoring the situation closely and will
            continue to provide information and assistance to travelers. As the situation is still evolving, airlines
            and other travel partners are continually reviewing
            their policies.</p>
        <p>We recommend you check the travel advisory from your local authority for travel planning.</p>
        <p>If you are due to travel soon and need to call us, please have your Trip ID number ready. This can be found
            by selecting your itinerary from
            My Trips.</p>

                <li>If your booking consists of 2 one-way fares, then ensure you check the policy of both airlines. If
                    one of your flights is
                    covered by a policy, it will not automatically cover the other flight.</li>
                <li>Check your travel insurance policy to see if changes and cancellations due to unforeseen events are
                    covered. If so,
                    contact your insurance provider for details on submitting a claim.</li>

                    Policies may change or be added at any time, so check for updates before rebooking.</li>
                <li>If your airline has not issued a policy and you still wish to change your flight please call us for
